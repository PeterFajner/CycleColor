This script provides a function, CycleColor (which is mapped to F4), to cycle through (almost) all available colorschemes.  It includes colorschemes from all \"colors\" subdirectories in the runtimepath.

Because the script uses \":colorscheme\" rather than \":source\" to set the colorscheme, if there are two files with the same name in different directories in rtp, only the first one will be used (thus \"almost\" above).

The script was inspired by a one-liner by Tim Chase.
